# BankingDemo
iOS example of classic banking-like complex UI


![](demo/demo.gif)


## Purpose

In this demo project I have tryed to reproduce UI and animations of detailed product screen from one famous yellow bank.
All resources such as fonts, colors and images/models were legally extracted from legally downloaded .ipa-file from AppStore or legally sniffed from requests using Charles.
All created elements and models are my fantasy and have nothing common with real app of self-claimed 'best online-bank in the galaxy'.

## Demo Structure

This demo is just one complex screen of bank products and their operations history. But in fact, it consist of 4 modules. 
It does not handle action touches because it's just a demo.
It has no server requests (except fake logos site). However, history request is mocked locally so that it imitates loading.
